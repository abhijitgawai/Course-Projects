<h4>This projects aims towards automation of Water Pumps in Agricultural Fields.</h4>



<h3>There are two motors in circuit. </h3>

* Connected to Tank - Motor starts to fill tank, when tank water level is below 150. Turn off after tank is full i.e. Tank level is 300 

* Connected to Farm - Motor starts when soil mositure is below 40. Motor stops when soil moisture is above 45

<br>

Water Level is measured by Ultrasonic Sensor<br>

Tempreture sensor is used to replicate moisture sensor<br>

Project is Done on simulator TinkerCad âˆ‡<br>

<br>

Arduino code is given in Repository
